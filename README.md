Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/shahidhk/iitm-network-auth-app/releases).

**Note: Windows and Mac systems might show some security warnings. Please override/ignore these restrictions and install the app, as these warnings occur due to not signing the executable, which requires buying a code-signing certificate.**

## Usage
